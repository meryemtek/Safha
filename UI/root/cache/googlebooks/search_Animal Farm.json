          "description": "When the animals of Manor Farm overthrow their human master, they dream of a society where all are equal, free, and happy. But as the pigs take control, that dream slowly turns into a nightmare. Promises of fairness fade, and new tyrants rise under the guise of equality. Through brilliant satire, Animal Farm (1945) explores how power can corrupt even the noblest ideals. Orwell\u0027s sharp prose and unforgettable characters expose the dark side of revolutions. A masterpiece of political allegory, this short novel remains as relevant today as when it was first published. It is a chilling reflection on how freedom can be lost\u2014and how easily truth can be rewritten.",
